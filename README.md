# Kim-Possible-Game
This is the game I made for the culminating assessment of Grade 10 Computer Studies, on Python using Pygame. 

It is based around the classic Disney Channel TV show, Kim Possible, and is a simple platformer game. Dr. Drakkens and Shego, the villains in the story, have robbed a bank and hidden coins in three different levels. 

Kim has to collect as many coins as possible and reach the door on each level, which only get harder, to move on to the next one. If she hits any of the obstacles, it's Game Over!
